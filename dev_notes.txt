Just some notes I have taken since there are issues 
I've come across while developing sspy:


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* There are several keys in the current ssp format
that it seems can be ignored. Simply knowing what
solver and service to load is enough to determine 
what to load with the need of package references.


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Some perl specific parts of the yaml format should
be removed since yaml loads data structures differently 
in python (creating objects as opposed to hashes in some cases).
Format should be made a bit more general. 


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* at this point I don't see what the priority would be good for.
Due to the structure of the components it must go in this strict
order during loading: 

services ->  apple runtime parameters -> connect solvers -> connect in/outs

So setting a numerical value to the precedence doesn't seem to matter.


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The key for "models" can take more than one model with their own sets
of runtime parameters. This may not be necessary since only one model
is handled at a time at this point. Would require a spawning of several 
scheduler instances for each to have their own sets of runtime parameters.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The modelname variable found under the "models" key should be moved to 
the solvers data block since it is needed to determine where the solver 
should perform its work from.


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Would most likely better if arguments for objects go with the object 
declaration in the file such as all outputs being listed under the outputclass
like:

outputclasses:
  double_2_ascii:
    options:
      filename: /tmp/output
    outputs:
      - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/soma
        field: Vm
      - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b0s01[0]
        field: Vm
      - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b0s03[56]
        field: Vm
      - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b1s06[137]
        field: Vm
      - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b1s12[26]
        field: Vm
      - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b2s30[3]
        field: Vm
      - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b3s44[49]
        field: Vm

instead of :

outputclasses:
  double_2_ascii:
    module_name: Experiment
    options:
      filename: /tmp/output
    package: Experiment::Output
outputs:
  - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/soma
    field: Vm
    outputclass: double_2_ascii
  - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b0s01[0]
    field: Vm
    outputclass: double_2_ascii
  - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b0s03[56]
    field: Vm
    outputclass: double_2_ascii
  - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b1s06[137]
    field: Vm
    outputclass: double_2_ascii
  - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b1s12[26]
    field: Vm
    outputclass: double_2_ascii
  - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b2s30[3]
    field: Vm
    outputclass: double_2_ascii
  - component_name: /Purkinje/segments/b3s44[49]
    field: Vm
    outputclass: double_2_ascii


This eliminates the need for the outputclass identifier on each output
and prevents having to loop through all outputs for each outputclass that
is declared.

Should note that due to clearly defining the objects
from the outset for dynamically loading, some of the
tags from an SSP compatible file will be ignored
since they are not needed. They are:

module: Tag isn't needed since each input, output, service and solver
is explicitly coded around an object plugin. 

method: Not needed since each object is coded with it's own cases for
handling loads when given certain data.
